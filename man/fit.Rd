\item{input_catalogue}{input signature profiles, NULL by default}

\item{lr}{stochastic variational inference learning rate}

\item{steps}{number of gradient steps}

\item{phi}{threshold to discard the signature based on its value in exposure matrix}

\item{delta}{threshold to consider inferred signature as COSMIC signature}

inferred exposure matrix, inferred signatures from reference catalogue and inferred de novo (not from reference catalogue) signatures

\description{
fit the model and infer the underlying signatures and their contributions in the mutational catalogue counts.
