\arguments{
\item{x}{input mutational counts data (data.frame; rows as samples and columns as 96 mutational categories)}

\item{reference_catalogue}{a catalog of reference signatures that basilica will use to compare input and de novo signatures (COSMIC catalogue by default)}

\item{k}{vector of possible number of de novo signatures to infer}

\item{lr}{stochastic variational inference learning rate}

\item{steps}{number of gradient steps}

\item{phi}{threshold to discard the signature based on its value in exposure matrix}

\item{delta}{threshold to consider inferred signature as COSMIC signature}

\item{groups}{vector of discrete labels with one entry per sample, it defines the groups that will be considered by basilica}

\item{input_catalogue}{input signature profiles, NULL by default}
}
\value{
inferred exposure matrix, inferred signatures from reference catalogue and inferred de novo (not from reference catalogue) signatures
}
\description{
fit the model and infer the underlying signatures and their contributions in the mutational catalogue counts.
